TODO:
    consistent AST naming
    simp, asop, postop
    AST headers into folders
    cleanup #includes
    comment functions
    functions
    arrays
    structs
    pack kernels into executable
    test else if
    decide how to print ASTs
    maybe an AST visitor
    maybe use switches to match against types because the compiler will warn
    better exception stuff
    avoid comparing strings everywhere
    don't really need to forward declare everything--we're smart enough
    expressions and arguments may not have type void
    functions can only be defined once
    make sure argument moves are eliminated
    shared ptr
    "modernize" the C++
    empty program or check for main or something
